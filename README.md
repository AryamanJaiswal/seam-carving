# seam-carving
This seam carving algorithm has the following capabilities:

chromaKey: This function can be found in Picture.java. We used a helper method resetPixel for this method that resets the color of a given pixel if its color distance is less than the threshold value.

flip: This function can also be found in the Picture.java file under the function signature provided in the starter code. It flips the image on a particular axis that can be one of horizontal, vertical, forward_diagonal, backward_diagonal. Therefore, we implemented 4 helper methods for this function (one for each of the options) We implemented flipHorizontal completely and then used a combination of rotate functions for the rest.

showEdges: This function can also be found in the Picture.java file under the function signature provided in the starter code.

We decided to experiment with the additional image-processing functions in Picture.java. We worked on the following functions:

chromaKey: This function can be found in Picture.java. We used a helper method resetPixel for this method that resets the color of a given pixel if its color distance is less than the threshold value.

showEdges: This function can also be found in the Picture.java file under the function signature provided in the starter code. Used a number of isValid helper functions to write this method.
